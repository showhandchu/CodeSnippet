First, check if tsc is installed correctly. Open cmd.exe and type the following.

%AppData%\npm\node_modules\typescript\bin\tsc --version
If there is a version log, then tsc is installed successfully.

The next thing is to add it in PATH. Write in cmd.exe

setx path "%path%;%AppData%\npm\node_modules\.bin\"
This should solve the issue.

However, if the first command did not log the version,

Check the install location using

npm list -g
If typescript appears in the output, copy the location to the PATH as

setx path "%path%;<--the tsc.exe path-->"
